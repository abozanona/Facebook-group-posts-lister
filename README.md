# Facebook group posts lister

A small script I made as a university project in *31/12/2015*

This scrips lists all the posts of a group between two dates.

You must be ad admin of that group.

You can get your group id from [https://lookup-id.com/](https://lookup-id.com/) .

You can get your Access tocken from [Facebook graph explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/?pnref=story) .
